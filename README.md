Hello world! Bonjour tout le monde! 

I am a Quant @ [NDVR Inc](https://ndvr.com/) focusing on options strategies. 

I studied Applied Mathematics and Financial Engineering at [École CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (formerly Ecole Centrale Paris), and [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/).

At MIT, I worked as a research intern and completed an R.A. under [Pr. Georgia Perakis](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/gperakis/) (co-director of [MIT Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/)) focusing on Applied Machine Learning. We were proudly honored to have our [model (MIT Cassandra)](https://github.com/oskali/mit_cassandra) deployed and maintained on the [CDC website](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.20.22274097v1.full.pdf) (_decommissioned in Mar. 2023_). Priorly, I interned as a Data Scientist at Descartes Trading in the cross-asset trading desk under Samer Comair, now President CIO at Drakai Capital SAS.

### Hobbies
I can be found counting laps in the pool, biking in Boston or playing 3v3/5v5 on the nearest basketball court.
I am an otaku, and I do enjoy reading research papers.

_Latest read (as of Sep. 2023)_: [High-Frequency Tail Risk Premium and Stock Return Predictability.](https://jfqa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/HFTR_JFQA_Rev2nRound_maintext_Ju23.pdf) C. Almeida, K. Ardison, G. Freire, René Garcia, and P. Orlowski. _Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis_. 2023. 

I am learning how to cook, play the piano, dance bachata. Whenever I get the chance, I jump on the next train or take the next flight!

Besides, I have nurtured a personal interest in documenting myself about behavioral disorders.
