Hello world, I am Quant Researcher @ [NDVR Inc](https://ndvr.com/) 

I studied Applied Mathematics and Financial Engineering at [École CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (formerly Ecole Centrale Paris), and [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/).

At MIT, I worked as a Research Intern and completed a R.A. under [Pr. Georgia Perakis](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/gperakis/) (co-director of [MIT Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/)) focusing on Applied Machine Learning. Priorly, I interned as a Data Scientist at Descartes Trading in the cross-asset trading desk under Samer Comair, now President CIO at Drakai Capital SAS.

### Hobbies
I can be found counting laps in the pool or playing 3v3/5v5 on the nearest basketball court.
I am an Otaku! and I do enjoy reading research papers

I am learning how to cook, play the piano, dance bachata.
Whenever I get the chance, I jump on the next train or take the next plane!
